## Contributing to RailsEventStore organization repositories

We use [Collective Code Construction Contract (C4)](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/) process.

Any kind of contribution is welcomed. Here is a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow.

## Found a bug? Have a question?

* [Create a new issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/), assuming one does not already exist.
* Clearly describe the problem including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
* If possible provide a Pull Request with failing test case.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on GitHub.

## Making Changes

We don't use branches (except master) in our repositories. You may or may not use
feature branches in your forked repository. Any changes must be submitted in form
of a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

* Do your work. Please try to keep your commits small and focused.
  Write descriptive commit messages (see `2.3. Patch Requirements` at [https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/))
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Push your to your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the one of RailsEventStore repositories.
